# Checkout System

This is a TypeScript implementation of a checkout system for a computer store. The system supports pricing rules and allows for easy extension in the future.

## Requirements

- TypeScript
- Jest for testing
- Node.js

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and checkout to the branch `task/code-challenge`:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yanyy5/code-challenge-bff.git
   
   cd code-challenge-bff

   git checkout task/code-challenge 

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

## Running the Application

1. Start the checkout system:

There is no UIs. So we can only create and test rules through `main.ts` or `*.test.ts` directly.

2. Run tests:

To ensure everything is working correctly, run the tests using Jest:

   ```bash
   npm test
